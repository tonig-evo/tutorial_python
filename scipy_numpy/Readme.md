## Numpy and Scipy

NumPy and SciPy are open-source add-on modules to Python that provide common mathematical and numerical routines in pre-compiled, fast functions. Have a look at [../Numpy_Tutorial.pdf](Numpy_Tutorial.pdf) to familiarise yourself with the two modules.

Also take a look at: http://www.loria.fr/~rougier/teaching/numpy/numpy.html (solutions to questions marked with an asterisk are hidden on the website)
